# Python-Hand-Cricket
Play hand cricket as an individual or a team of 11 against a team of 11 bots for free on the Python Command Line Interface! More information about the gameplay is available in "Hand Cricket Python App Documentation.pdf" in this repository, which you can read just by clicking on it!

## Getting Started:
### Rules of the game:
This game is like hand cricket and runs on Python. To know more about hand cricket, visit https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Play-Hand-Cricket/

However, you will find some differences in the game. The ‘stok’ moves which otherwise adds the bowler’s input to your score adds zero in the app.

Whatever you show your opponent, enter its value. For example, showing an open palm to your opponent represents 5. Input 5 and not ‘open palm’.

The ultimate goal is simple: Score more than your opponent to win.
### Pre-requisites:
To play this game, you need to have Python software installed. The software was built on Python 3.7.4, while the newest release as of 24 March 2021 is Python 3.9.2. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads to install the latest version or https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374 to install version 3.7.4.

Supported platforms:

•	Microsoft Windows 7 or later

•	Android API 24 or later (Apps are available on the Play Store)

•	Mac OS X 10.6 or later

•	Linux 

NOTE: As Windows XP uses Python 2.7 as its last version, developers can modify the code for this purpose.

Either use git clone or download this entire repository to play this game.

Disk space: 10 MB (minimum).

### About this project

This is the legacy hand cricket game – implemented in Python and supporting text files.

This project was built entirely on Python 3.7.4 and is compatible with all later versions as well. 

The game can be played even without an internet connection.

Tournament mode is not yet included in this game. Customized tournaments can be created using individual team files. For such tournaments, at least 20 MB of disk space is recommended.

### Known bugs

A hack exists wherein a team may abruptly and deliberately close the application to avoid losing a match. This bug is not fixed since a more serious bug, in which unexpected crashes would lead to a loss irrespective of the position, would otherwise overshadow the possibility of victory. 

Rain delay and abandoned matches are not yet implemented in this game. However, deliberately closing the application, as described above, is considered as an abandoned match.
