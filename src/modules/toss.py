# Toss: The AI has a number in its mind. You select any number from 0 to 6.

    Arguments:
    team1_data: JSON representation of the team file of the first team
    team2_data: JSON representation of the team file of the second team

    Returns:
    A string, either "bat" or "field"

    Description:
    The player must select an integer.
    Then, the bot will select either 0 or 1.
    The player must decide if the sum of these integers is odd or even.
    If the prediction is correct, the player wins the toss.
    Then, the player can choose batting or fielding (bowling)
    If the player loses the toss, or chooses something else,
        then the bot will choose whether to bat or field first.
